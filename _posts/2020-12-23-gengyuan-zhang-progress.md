Gengyuan is not that busy today, i.e. not much urgent needs to do. He can start to get familiar with something he didn't, learn something new and can pick up more that he planned to do but he didn't have the time to. He feels that there are so many interesting things he can learn, he feels so excited and interested.

Gengyuan plans to set some password in one of the Github webpage, it is on his to-do list, let's see when he can accomplish this!
