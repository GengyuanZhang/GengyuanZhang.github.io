Well. I made minor changes and pushed to the website, although it required more steps than operations on Github, but it works! I met an issue when trying to pull the most recent github repository, and I found that after I disabled the 2FA (two-factor authentication), it worked out. But it did not work with 2FA. I will think about how to solve this problem. Overall glad I am able to make minor changes to the site of the company!
