Gengyuan did the followings today:

1) Installing MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html).

2) Installing Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community

3) After fixing the "undefined index" problem with the help from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64620849/laravel-packagemanifest-php-line-131-undefined-index-name), the company's backend has run successfully on my local! Cheers!

Backend really takes another day to get it finished.

Notes: 
Next time when I run the backend on my local, I need to update the .env file as in the documentation.
