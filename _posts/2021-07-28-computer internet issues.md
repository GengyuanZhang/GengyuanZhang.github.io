It is the second time I met similar issue, we might need to change DNS in the computer.

The first time is when my laptop can be connected with QQ, Wechat, but it can not connect to different webpage; the second time is when my laptop can be connected with different webpages, but not QQ, Wechat or even dropbox or NetEase Music.
