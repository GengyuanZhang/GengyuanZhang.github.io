Gengyuan read two very helpful webpage, one is [comparison of Django vs Laravel vs NodeJS](https://nimapinfotech.com/blog/django-vs-laravel-vs-nodejs/), the other is [comparison of Angular vs React vs Vue](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/). Now Gengyuan has a better understanding of the front-end frameworks and back-end frameworks.

One of the company site is a combination of Angular (front-end) and Laravel (back-end), the other is also using Angular as the front-end, we will see if we will use Laravel or NodeJS as the backend, it looks NodeJS is much better than Laravel.

Yesterday, Gengyuan successfully connected Angular-Laravel-MySQL database for one site in his local, he can do more complex changes then! And for the other site, he will help to see if he could help figure it out the stuck issue.
