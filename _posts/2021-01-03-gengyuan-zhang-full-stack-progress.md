In the past a few days, Gengyuan accomplished the CFB, CBB, Soccer (EPL, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga, Ligue 1) from data, modeling, backend-API, front-end Javascript of the site in the past a few days, feel soooooo great!

Gengyuan re-installed the MobaXterm, which he used a lot during his Ph.D. It is still quite useful now, even Gengyuan already got familiar with some of its alternatives, such as Putty.

It looks Putty is a little faster than MobaXterm.

In the local deployment of backend Laravel, it looks the "Extensions" folder is wrongly named by "Exceptions".
