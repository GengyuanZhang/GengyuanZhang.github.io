Well. I made minor changes and pushed to the website, although it required more steps than operations on Github, but it works! I met an issue when trying to pull the most recent github repository, and I found that after I disabled the 2FA (two-factor authentication), it worked out. But it did not work with 2FA. After a simple search, I figured out the solution [here](https://webkul.com/blog/github-push-with-two-factor-authentication/), feels great!

Very interesting, why I didn't learn Computer Science major before ~~(>_<)~~? Learning computer science might also be a great experience!
